This project has been made by Ignacio Pino Tejón from the International class.

BACKGROUND / IMPRESSIONS
As something to highlight about my project in this document, 
I would like to point out above all that I have had quite a few delays (days) due to the many errors and problems that new technologies and 
new configurations constantly caused me due to incompatibilities, installation errors, etc.

On the other hand, thanks to this I have learned a lot about it, and although the project has remained unfinished as of today (10/11/24), 
I am glad to have had those errors and to have been able to learn from them.

Added to my health issues absence and personal situation, for almost 2 weeks, I have not been able to finish everything yet.

I would like to be able to continue, if it is acceptable, and to be able to finish it during the vacation week and be able to deliver a good job, 
or at least the minimum required.

I'm looking forward to talk about all this issues I had and to listen/read about how can I make it better and improve 
for the following assignments and projects. I'll appreciate any review that might help me with all the chaos ive had here.

Thanks in advance
